## Usage

- Require [Even Better Toml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml). I didn't test other toml extensions.

- If you saw a lot of empty strings in scenario like `serde = ""`, I believe it's the auto completion from `Even Better Toml`'s `cargo.toml` schema.
